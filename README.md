Cybersecurity threats are on the rise, with attackers employing phishing emails, malware, and deepfakes to steal and misuse personal information. Identity theft and financial fraud are becoming more common as hackers exploit weaknesses in online platforms and human behavior. Traditional security measures often fail to detect advanced attacks, leaving users exposed to digital manipulation and data breaches. The rise of AI-generated content has made it even more challenging to distinguish between real and fake information, thereby increasing the risks to online safety. To address this, I developed an app to help users detect deepfakes, phishing, and content theft, keeping their digital identity safe.

Introducing **IdentityGuard:** a web application with AI-powered tools designed to protect users from these growing cybersecurity risks!
